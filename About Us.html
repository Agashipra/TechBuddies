    <h1>✿ OUR STORY ✿</h1>
    <p>
      Our story starts in 2014 when our founders were also teachers and often encountered the problem of finding a teaching job vacancy near their location. Soon, they realized that this was not only their problem but a hectic process for most teachers. Similarly, after talking to some parents, they discovered that parents are also worried about finding an experienced and well-qualified teacher for their child. Students and parents were also having difficulties hiring a private tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then when our founders identified an opportunity to start a venture that would help in eliminating the unnecessary inconvenience faced by students, parents, and teachers. After a few months of market research and planning, TeachBuddies was started to narrow the gap between teachers struggling to find better tutoring jobs and students willing to hire a home tutor. It paved the way for working professionals to look for a part-time job after office hours and housewives to take up teaching as a part-time profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is to make education available for every student and provide an opportunity for teachers to earn a good salary by sharing their knowledge. We strive to enhance our services continuously and deliver a better experience to our users every time.
